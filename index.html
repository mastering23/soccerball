  <h2>SOCCER BALLS INFORMATION</h2>

  <p>Soccer balls are typically made from either leather or synthetic materials.</p>
  <p>Leather balls are more durable and provide better touch and feel, but they are also more expensive. </p>
  <p>Synthetic balls, on the other hand, are less expensive and more water-resistant, making them a good choice for outdoor play.</p>
